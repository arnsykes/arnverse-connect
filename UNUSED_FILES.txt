# UNUSED FILES - ARNVERSE Frontend

## Potentially Unused Files
(After thorough analysis, most files appear to be used)

## Legacy/Backup Files
(None identified - clean codebase)

## Files That Could Be Removed (with caution)
- None identified at this time

## Development-Only Files (Safe to ignore in production)
- bun.lockb - Package lock file
- .gitignore - Git configuration
- components.json - Shadcn/ui configuration
- postcss.config.js - PostCSS configuration
- tsconfig.*.json - TypeScript configuration files

## Notes
- All src/ files appear to be actively used
- All components in src/components/ui/ are part of the shadcn/ui system
- All pages in src/pages/ are referenced in routing
- All hooks in src/hooks/ are used by components
- No dead code or unused imports identified

## Recommendations
- The codebase is well-organized with minimal unused files
- Consider periodic dependency audit with `npm audit` or similar tools
- Monitor bundle size with build analyzers if performance becomes an issue
- All current files should be kept for proper functionality
